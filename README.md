# Blockchain-Conferences

Starting with my first post about Blockchain conference: This month, I have attended CPC Cryptocurrency and Exchange Conference at Stanford University. This conference was hosted by Professor Whitfield Diffie and the Cardinal Pitch Club at Stanford Faculty. Yes, I was in a land of high intellectuals and a dreamland of every computer scientist. As I was in California for the first time I could feel that startup vibe too.


Major topics: Blockchain with IOT, AI, Machine learning.

I met Professor Diffie "who won the 2015 Turing Award for fundamental contributions to modern cryptography, widely considered the most prestigious award in the field of computer science. He was the inventor of public-key cryptography and introduced digital signatures, which are the foundation for most regularly-used security protocols on the internet today."

I also met He Yi, the co-founder of Binance. In her speech she gave a analogy between Crypto-currency trend to a religion, she also mentioned Satoshi Nakamoto to explain the theory.

Exchanges who were present: Binance, Bittrex, Coinone, Kraken.

We also had Larry Sanger: Co-founder of Wikipedia, Eric Ly: Co-founder of Linkedin in the panel. 

Conclusion:
 
I have learned the shortcomings of current Blockchain architecture such as Ethereum network is not scalable, security issues. That's why Vitalik Buterin is coming with Plasma scaling on Ethereum which makes sense too. 
After discussing with startup founders, advisors all around the globe on various innovative ideas, I have realized that there is a need of security in current blockchain development. Smart contracts are growing at an exponential rate and could become a billion dollar market, yet are vulnerable to hacks that prevent widespread adoption.
